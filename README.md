# Language Translator
A language translator using Google API, coded in Python. Say any word/phrase/sentence and translate it into one of the hundreds of languages offered using this simple program.

NOTE: In order for the program to work, you have to import the _googletrans_, _pyaudio_, _SpeechRecognition_ and _gtts_ libraries. You can use pip to install these in the following way:

- `pip install googletrans`
- `pip install pyaudio`
- `pip install SpeechRecognition`
- `pip install gtts`

To use the program, run `python3 Language Translator.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3. I hope you enjoy and find it helpful!
